xes-utils
---------

This is a set of scripts and utilities that provide convenience functions
for X-ES boards running Linux.  Most of these are written in bash and
attempt to support a variety of X-ES boards and architectures.

Installation
------------

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

Note that if you are using an official X-ES Gentoo-based Linux distribution,
then the xes-utils package is probably already installed onto your system.

Usage
-----

Each tool installed will be prefixed with "xes-", so the easiest way to
get started is to just type "xes-" in your shell and hit [TAB] to see
a list of available commands.
