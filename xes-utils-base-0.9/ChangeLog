* Thu Dec 3 2009 Peter Tyser
- (160fef3) functions-xes: Add support for determing board name via DMI x86 product names are exposed via DMI data in Linux's sysfs filesystem. Use the sysfs DMI product name to return a proper value for the xes_board_name() function.

* Wed Dec 2 2009 Peter Tyser
- (17805eb) xes-utils: Use 'bash' instead of 'sh' (revert of r20129) A /bin/bash wrapper script was recently added to X-ES's busybox-based filesystems which allows the use of busybox's 'ash' shell to emulate 'bash'.  This allows the use of /bin/bash as a script interpreter in all filesystems, so use it instead of /bin/sh for xes-utils.

* Wed Dec 2 2009 Peter Tyser
- (ac5bf43) xes-getty: Fix 'setsid' location By default busybox installs 'setsid' at /usr/bin/setsid, not /bin/setsid

* Tue Dec 1 2009 Peter Tyser
- (ff0e109) xes-getty: Call 'getty' via 'setsid cttyhack' when using busybox When using busybox's init process, getty is not executed with a controlling terminal when called via the xes-getty script.  This results in the following error during login:   ash: can't access tty; job control turned off

* Tue Dec 1 2009 Peter Tyser
- (8f04e72) xes-showtemp: Add XPedite51xx temperature sensor information

* Tue Dec 1 2009 Peter Tyser
- (9b3da4d) xes-utils: Use 'sh' instead of 'bash' By default, a filesystem based on busybox does not include a 'bash' executable.  Using 'sh' instead of 'bash' should allow these scripts to work with a default busybox installation out of the box.  Note that on most filesystems 'sh' is just a symlink to another shell, eg generally 'bash' on a fully functional filesystem and 'ash' on a busybox-based filesystems.

* Wed Oct 14 2009 Nate Case

* Fri Jun 19 2009 Brian Brinsko
- (e0b6333) Reimplemented xes-gpio so that it will first try to use the /sys gpio interface and if it can't it will fall back to the normal i2c interface.

- (7f66864) Fix number of cores detection to work with newer kernels.
