Board configuration files in this directory are loaded based on the
detected board name (via device tree on PowerPC, and DMI on x86).

Scripts load configuration files as follows:

1) First source global.conf
2) Load any wildcard-matched configuration files (e.g., xpedite100x.conf) if
   the filename matches the board name
3) Load the board-specific configuration file (e.g., xpedite1000.conf)

Note that *all* of the matching configuration files are loaded if they
exist.  That is, for an XPedite1000, global.conf, xpedite100x.conf, and
xpedite1000.conf will all get sourced (in that order).
